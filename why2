1. The fourth point is nonzero because in the second example the weights have been updated and the fourth point shares tilings with the second example so it's using the six of the weights from the second example.

2. Since the target is nonstationary, the training function cannot account for the variablilty in the target caused by the addition of a variable taken from a distribution with mean zero and standard deviation 0.1. The mean error will equal the variability, 0.1, and the MSE=(0.1)^2=0.01.
